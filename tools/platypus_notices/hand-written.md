# Third-party notices

Platypus (Copyright 2026 The Platypus Authors) is under the Apache License 2.0. The Platypus host
(`platypus-app`, the program inside every game made with Platypus) is built from the third-party
software below; their licences ask for these notices to go with the program.

This file is built into the host: `platypus-app --licenses` prints it, and `platypus-build package`
writes it beside every packaged executable. Keep it with the program when you pass it on.

The first part covers native code, fonts and other assets built into the host; the second part
lists every Rust crate it is built from, one section per licence.

A game's own assets (models, textures, sounds, music, fonts) and their credits are the game's
responsibility, not part of these notices: ship their licences with the game. The Platypus
examples keep theirs in `assets/CREDITS.md` and, for the Charm font, `assets/fonts/OFL.txt`.

# Native code, fonts and assets

Everything else built into the host is Platypus's own: its code, shaders, the Platypus icon and
the mascot (Apache-2.0, as above).

## ANGLE (BSD-3-Clause)

The Windows host links ANGLE into the program (the `static-angle` feature: EGL and OpenGL ES
over Direct3D 11). It is built and linked through the `mozangle` crate, Mozilla's repackaging of
ANGLE for Rust (BSD-3-Clause, below). ANGLE and the code it brings with it are under the licences
of this part.

## mozangle (BSD-3-Clause)

The crate that builds ANGLE for Rust and links it into the host (Mozilla / the Servo project) is
under the same ANGLE BSD-3-Clause license as above (Copyright (C) 2002-2013 The ANGLE Project
Authors). It is also listed with the Rust crates, under BSD-3-Clause.

## Chromium base code in ANGLE (BSD-3-Clause)

ANGLE's `src/common/third_party/base` (SHA-1, numerics, containers) and
`third_party/zlib/google` come from Chromium.

## Inter (SIL Open Font License 1.1)

The host's default UI font, Inter (`InterVariable.ttf` and `InterVariable-Italic.ttf`, built
into `platypus_ui`), is by The Inter Project Authors (https://github.com/rsms/inter), under
the SIL Open Font License 1.1:

```text
Copyright 2020 The Inter Project Authors (https://github.com/rsms/inter)

This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:
https://openfontlicense.org


-----------------------------------------------------------
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
