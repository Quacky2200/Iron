# Windows: a `Window` class for games (design)

Status: design, 2026-10-21; revised the same day with the user's answers (families and event domains, section 3a;
messages, section 3b; `Window.main` as a static property in both backends; section 14). Steps: [iron-windows-plan.md](iron-windows-plan.md). Test IDs: `M9-API-1400..1499`,
`M9-TS-2800..2899`.

## 1. What the user asked for

- The **game** names its window. The manifest title (`iron.title` in `package.json` today, `title` in `project.json` once
  that lands) is only the title the window opens with; `Window.main.title = "..."` changes it at any time.
- Games make **more windows**: tool windows (palettes, inspectors) owned by the main window, dialogs, popups, borderless
  windows, each with its **own UI** (`createRoot(win).render(<Panel/>)`).
- A window can be asked for its parent (`win.parent`), whether it is a child (`win.isChild`), its handle (`win.handle`,
  `win.nativeHandle`), its style (get and set), and can be closed.
- An example, `examples/windows`, that creates and manages tool windows.

Constraints that shape the design:

- **GPU caution.** The user's PC has hard-reset with the Iron window open (an NVIDIA instability older than Iron). More windows
  means more swapchains. Every automated check in the plan is a fake-backend test or a `--screenshot` run, and screenshot runs
  make **no OS window for secondary windows** (they render offscreen, section 7.4). Nothing in the plan opens an interactive
  window.
- **Rust owns the world, JS owns behaviour.** Scripts hold `Window` handles (numbers inside); the OS windows, surfaces and UI
  trees live in Rust.
- **One API for both runtimes.** Declared once with `#[iron_api(namespace = "Window", quickjs, handles(Window = WindowRef))]`
  in `iron_engine_api`, like `Screen` and `Cursor`; compiled games (`iron_ts`) and QuickJS both get it.

## 2. Findings: what the stack gives us

### 2.1 winit 0.30.13 (Cargo.lock)

| Need | winit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Many windows, one loop | `ActiveEventLoop::create_window(attrs)` at any callback; `window_event(.., WindowId, ..)` | Creation needs the `ActiveEventLoop`, so scripts' requests are queued and run by the platform in its callbacks. |
| Title, size, position | `with_title`, `with_inner_size`, `with_min_inner_size`, `with_position`; `set_title`, `request_inner_size`, `set_outer_position`, `outer_position`, `inner_size` | Positions are of the outer frame, sizes of the client area. |
| Buttons, resizing | `with_resizable`, `with_enabled_buttons(WindowButtons)`; setters | |
| Always on top | `WindowLevel::{AlwaysOnTop, Normal, AlwaysOnBottom}` | Win32 `WS_EX_TOPMOST`; macOS `kCGFloatingWindowLevel`; X11 `_NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE`. |
| Borderless | `with_decorations(false)` | |
| Visible, minimise, maximise, focus | `set_visible`, `set_minimized`, `set_maximized`, `focus_window`, `has_focus`; `with_active(false)` opens without taking focus | |
| **Owner (Windows)** | `WindowAttributesExtWindows::with_owner_window(HWND)` | Owned windows stay above the owner, hide when it is minimised, are destroyed with it, and have no taskbar button. |
| Taskbar | `with_skip_taskbar(bool)` / `set_skip_taskbar` (Windows, `ITaskbarList::DeleteTab`) | Not on X11, Wayland or macOS. |
| Modal (Windows) | `WindowExtWindows::set_enable(false)` on the owner | Later (D2). |
| **Parent** | `unsafe with_parent_window(Option<RawWindowHandle>)` | Windows: `WS_CHILD`, confined to the parent's client area. X11: reparented inside the parent. **macOS: `addChildWindow:ordered:`** (an owned floating window that moves with its parent, not an embedded one). Wayland, iOS, Android, web: unsupported. |
| X11 window types | `WindowAttributesExtX11::with_x11_window_type(vec![WindowType::Utility])` | No `WM_TRANSIENT_FOR` in winit 0.30, so X11 tool windows are not tied to the main window. |
| Wayland | nothing for parents | No `xdg_toplevel.set_parent` in winit 0.30; tool windows are plain toplevels. |
| macOS panels | no `NSPanel`; `WindowAttributesExtMacOS` has title bar options only | `NSWindowStyleMaskUtilityWindow` needs an `NSPanel`; out of scope. |
| Events | `CloseRequested`, `Destroyed`, `Resized`, `Moved`, `Focused`, `ScaleFactorChanged`, `Occluded`, keyboard, mouse, IME, file drops | All per `WindowId`. |
| Per-window DPI | `Window::scale_factor()` and `ScaleFactorChanged` per window | |
| IME | `set_ime_allowed`, `set_ime_cursor_area` per window | |
| Cursor | `set_cursor`, `set_cursor_grab` per window | |

**`WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` needs raw Win32.** winit has no option for the small tool caption. Worse, winit rewrites
`GWL_EXSTYLE` from its own flags in `WindowFlags::apply_diff` (`window_state.rs`: `SetWindowLongW(window, GWL_EXSTYLE,
style_ex)`) every time a flag changes (`set_visible`, `set_resizable`, maximise, decorations...), so setting the style once
after creation would be undone at the first `set_visible(true)`. The fix: **subclass the window** with
`SetWindowSubclass` (comctl32, `windows-sys` feature `Win32_UI_Shell`, already in the registry at 0.52) and, in
`WM_STYLECHANGING` for `GWL_EXSTYLE`, OR `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` into `STYLESTRUCT.styleNew` (and drop `WS_EX_APPWINDOW`). The
style is applied once with `SetWindowLongPtrW` + `SetWindowPos(SWP_FRAMECHANGED | SWP_NOMOVE | SWP_NOSIZE | SWP_NOZORDER |
SWP_NOACTIVATE)` and the subclass keeps it. `iron_platform` already uses `windows-sys` 0.52 (winit's version) for the black
class brush; the plan adds the `Win32_UI_Shell` feature. No new crate.

Alt-Tab and the taskbar on Windows: a window shows in both when it is unowned or has `WS_EX_APPWINDOW`, and is hidden from both
when it has `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW`. An owned window without `WS_EX_APPWINDOW` already has no taskbar button; `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW`
also removes it from Alt-Tab and gives the small caption. `with_skip_taskbar(true)` is set too, harmlessly, for the cases winit
re-adds `WS_EX_APPWINDOW` (it does when `ON_TASKBAR` is set).

### 2.2 wgpu 30 and `iron_render`

- `Gpu` holds one `Instance`, `Adapter`, `Device`, `Queue`; `Gpu::with_surface` makes the instance, the first surface and the
  adapter together. Further surfaces come from `gpu.instance.create_surface(Arc<Window>)`; `adapter.is_surface_supported` checks
  them (on desktop one adapter drives every window on its monitors; a window moved to a monitor on another GPU still works through
  the OS's copy path).
- `WindowSurface` (`surface.rs`) already tolerates 0 x 0 (minimised) and outdated surfaces and owns its present mode and
  `desired_maximum_frame_latency` (1, or 2 on DX12). Each secondary window gets one more `WindowSurface`.
- `UiRenderer` already renders into targets of different formats (the screen, panel textures in `Rgba8UnormSrgb`, offscreen
  screenshots), so **one `UiRenderer` and one `WorldRenderer` serve every window**: glyph atlas, images and pipelines are shared.
- **Frame pacing.** Vsync is off by default (`AutoNoVsync`: mailbox or immediate), so presenting N swapchains in a row does not
  block. With vsync on, presenting several FIFO swapchains in one thread can wait a vblank per window on some drivers (the frame
  rate divides by N). So **secondary windows always present with vsync off**; the main window follows
  `QualitySettings.vSyncCount` as today. Secondary windows draw once per main frame; a minimised, hidden or 0 x 0 window is
  skipped by `WindowSurface` itself.

### 2.3 Iron today (base `c3ffc1b`)

- `iron_platform::Platform::run(WindowConfig, app)` makes **one** window in `resumed`, hidden until its first frame, and calls
  `PlatformApp::{window_ready, input, frame, ...}`. `window_event` ignores the `WindowId`; `CloseRequested` exits the loop.
- `iron_app::App` has one `Gfx { gpu, surface, window, renderer, world }`, the screen `UiTree` (`self.ui`) with its
  `Interaction`, and `Surface::{Screen, Panel(id)}` routing for the pointer and keys between the screen and world panels.
- World panels (`panels.rs`) are the model for per-window UI: their own `UiTree`, `Interaction`, stylesheet and font copies
  (`new_panel_tree`), QuickJS commits with a target id, and for compiled games their own `iron_ui_native::Runtime`
  (`native_render.rs`) fed by `UiRoot.mount(panel, element)` (`iron_ts_ui::mount`).
- The `Screen` API (`iron_engine_api::screen`) is per thread with host functions (`update`, `set_display`, `take_requests`).
  The `Window` module copies that pattern.
- `--screenshot` renders the main window offscreen at its size and writes one PNG.

## 3. The TypeScript API

What scripts see (the generated `.d.ts` plus the hand-written supplement in `engine_ts.d.ts`). The QuickJS column of section 6
lists where QuickJS differs.

```ts

   *  always have one). For "normal" and "borderless" it defaults to none: the window is the ROOT of a new, ISOLATED
   *  family with its own event domain. `parent: null` and leaving it out mean the same (compiled code cannot tell

Usage:

```tsx
Window.main.title = `My Game (level ${level})`;

const palette = Window.create({ title: "Palette", style: "tool", width: 220, height: 320, key: "palette" });
createRoot(palette).render(<Palette />);
palette.onCloseRequested(() => { palette.cancelClose(); palette.visible = false; }); // hide instead of closing

if (palette.isChild) console.log(`owned by ${palette.parent?.title}`);
```

Rules:

- **`Window.main` is never closed by scripts**: `Window.main.close()` is `Application.quit()`.
- **Screen API stays the main window's.** `Screen.width` / `height` / `fullScreen` / `setResolution` keep working on the main
  window only; a tool window's size is `win.width` / `height`. Fullscreen secondary windows are out of scope.
- **Units.** Sizes and positions are UI pixels (winit `Logical*` with that window's scale factor). With monitors of different
  DPI, a position is converted with the scale of the monitor the window is on, as winit does.
- **Handles.** `WindowRef(u32)` as raw `u64`; 1 is the main window and ids grow from 2 (`Handle` rule: never 0).
- **Across families**, a `Window` handle may be read (title, size, `isOpen`) but not changed: setters, `close`, `focus` and
  listener registration on a window of another domain are refused with a warning naming both windows. Messages are the way
  to ask another family to do something. **One exception, the setup:** the code that created an isolated root may, until
  the end of that frame, set it up: `createRoot(win)`, `win.on*` listeners and `win.run(f)`. Whoever registers them, the
  root's UI and listeners always run in the root's own domain.
- **`win.run(f: () => void)`** queues `f` to run once in `win`'s domain at the start of its next dispatch: the "main
  function" of an isolated domain (register `Window.onMessage` / `onRequest` there, start its timers). Allowed for the
  window's own domain at any time, and for its creator during setup.

## 3a. Families and event domains

**Family.** A root window (a window without a parent) plus every window whose `parent` chain leads to it. `Window.main` is
the root of the main family. A family's members are `root`-equal.

**Event domain.** Each family has one event domain (id = the root's handle). Windows of one family share it; windows of
different families never share anything but the process. A domain owns:

| Per domain | What it means |
|---|---|
| Focus | The domain is focused when any of its windows has OS focus. Focus moving between the main window and its tool windows keeps the main domain focused (no pause). An isolated window taking focus unfocuses the main domain. |
| Input state | `input.getKey*`, mouse buttons and position, text and IME focus, the UI `Interaction`s of its windows. Keys pressed in an isolated window never reach the main game's `input`. Gamepads stay global (they have no window) and go to the focused domain, or the main domain when none is focused. |
| Pause / resume | Its own `Lifecycle`: the main domain pauses as today (unfocused and `Application.runInBackground` off: no ticks, physics or audio, `onApplicationFocus` / `onApplicationPause`). An isolated domain has `runInBackground` (default true); paused, its timers stop. `Window.onDomainFocusChanged` tells each domain. |
| Timers and queue | `setTimeout` / `setInterval` / promise jobs registered while the domain is current fire with it current again, and wait while it is paused. Its message queue is drained at the start of its dispatch. |
| UI roots | Each window's `createRoot(win)` root, mounted and flushed with the domain current. |
| Current domain | `Window.current` and the domain of `Window.current` while its code runs: UI handlers, window callbacks, messages, timers. Component hooks (`onUpdate`...) belong to the scene, which is the main domain's. |

**One event loop, many queues.** winit allows one `EventLoop` per process, created on the main thread (required on macOS,
and `EventLoop::new` fails a second time anywhere). So "each isolated window has its own event loop" is built as:

- **Phase A (this plan): same thread, separate dispatch queues.** The platform loop on the main thread receives every
  window's events and the app forwards each to its window's domain queue (`DomainId` from `WindowTree` root). Once per frame
  the app pumps the domains in a fixed order, main first: for each, with that domain current, it delivers its messages,
  runs its due timers (unless paused), dispatches its queued input and UI events, then flushes its UI roots. The game's scene
  tick stays the main domain's step. All domains run in the one script runtime (one heap): isolation is enforced at the API
  (input and focus are per domain, cross-family window changes are refused, handles can't travel in messages), not by the
  memory model. A slow handler in one domain still delays the others.
- **Phase B (later): a domain on its own thread.** Iron's engine API state is already per thread (`thread_local!` in
  `iron_engine_api`, `iron_scene::api::enter`, `iron_render_api`, `iron_physics_api`), so a domain thread starts with empty
  engine state of its own. It would need: its own script runtime (a second QuickJS runtime, or for compiled games a second
  JIT instance of the program with its own globals: each compile already gets its own `struct_base`, but module globals of
  one instance are shared between threads today, so a second compile is required), its own `Scene`, UI trees and native UI
  runtimes; channels for the main thread to forward window events and for the domain to send back draw lists
  (`Vec<DrawCmd>` per window: the main thread keeps the GPU, the `UiRenderer` and the surfaces, so drawing stays where the
  windows are); messages over the same channels (they are already JSON text). Window requests from the domain go to the
  main thread's queue. Nothing in phase A's API changes for that: messages are already the only cross-family path and they
  are asynchronous.
- **Phase C (later still): a domain in another process.** The same message format over a pipe; the child process makes its
  own winit loop and window (an OS window of another process cannot be an owned tool window portably, so such windows are
  normal top-level windows). Useful for crash isolation of editor tools; out of scope.

## 3b. Messages between windows

```ts
const inspector = Window.create({ title: "Inspector", style: "normal", width: 320, height: 480 }); // no parent: isolated
inspector.postMessage({ kind: "select", name: "Player", position: new Vector3(1, 2, 3) });
const stats = await inspector.request<{ count: number }>({ kind: "stats" });

// Set up the inspector's domain (allowed for its creator this frame); the listeners run in the inspector's domain:
inspector.run(() => {
  Window.current.onMessage<{ kind: string; name: string; position: [number, number, number] }>((from, msg) => { ... });
  Window.onRequest<{ kind: string }, { count: number }>((from, req, reply) => reply({ count: 3 }));
});
```

- **Data.** Structured values: numbers, strings, booleans, `null`, arrays, plain objects, and value classes in their compact
  JSON form (`Vector3` travels as `[x, y, z]`, as `toJSON` gives; the receiver rebuilds it with `Vector3.fromJSON` or types the
  field as a tuple). Not allowed: handles of any kind (`GameObject`, `Component`, `Texture`, `Window`...: send `win.handle` and
  use `Window.byHandle(n)`), functions, class instances other than value classes, `undefined` at the top level, cycles. The
  wire form is JSON text: the compiled side lowers `postMessage(data)` to `JSON.stringify` of the argument's static type (a
  handle type anywhere in it is a compile error) and `onMessage<T>` to `JSON.parse` typed as `T` (a shape mismatch is a
  `TypeError` thrown in the listener, logged); QuickJS stringifies with a replacer that throws `TypeError` on handle objects
  and functions.
- **Size.** At most 1 MiB of UTF-8 JSON per message; larger is refused (`false`, logged).
- **Delivery.** Always asynchronous, also within a family: queued for the target's domain and delivered at the start of
  that domain's next dispatch (the same frame if that domain's turn has not come yet, else the next). Order is kept per
  sender (one FIFO queue per receiving domain, filled in posting order). The target's `onMessage` listeners run first, then
  the domain's `Window.onMessage` listeners. `from` is `Window.current` when it was posted. A message to a window that closes
  before delivery is dropped (a pending `request` rejects).
- **Requests.** `request` posts with a fresh request id; delivery runs the target's `onRequest`, then the domain's
  `Window.onRequest`, until one calls `reply`; the reply travels back as a message to the sender's domain and resolves the
  promise there. A listener may reply later (after its own `await`), so a request without a reply only rejects on the
  timeout, when the target closes, or when its domain has no `onRequest` listener at all at delivery
  (`Error("no request listener")`).
- **How requests are built.** The engine has no promise across the boundary: `request` is a prelude helper on both sides
  (compiled: `facade.ts`; QuickJS: a JS snippet installed with the class) over `postRequestJson(win, text) -> id` and a
  per-domain `onReplyJson(id, text, error)` hook; `reply` is `Window.replyJson(id, text)`.
- **Broadcast.** `Window.broadcast(data)` posts to the root of every family except the sender's own.
- **Within a family** direct calls keep working (same domain, same heap): messages are optional there.
- **Engine side.** Messages are `(from, to, text, request id, reply-to id)` records in `iron_engine_api::window`; the app
  only pumps them per domain. In phase B they are what crosses the channel.

## 4. Styles per platform

| Style | Meaning | Windows | macOS | X11 | Wayland |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `normal` | An ordinary top-level window with its own taskbar button | default attributes | default | default | default |
| `tool` | Palette or inspector: small caption, no taskbar button, not in Alt-Tab, stays above its owner, hidden while the owner is minimised, closed with it | `with_owner_window(owner)`, `with_skip_taskbar(true)`, `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` (subclass, 2.1), buttons: close only | `with_parent_window(owner AppKit handle)` = `addChildWindow` (above the owner, moves with it); normal caption | `with_x11_window_type([Utility])`; not tied to the owner | plain toplevel |
| `dialog` | A question or settings box over its owner: full caption, no taskbar button, not resizable by default | `with_owner_window`, `with_skip_taskbar(true)`, buttons: close | child window as `tool` | `[Dialog]` | plain |
| `popup` | Undecorated owned window (menus, tooltips, splash); does not take focus by default | `with_owner_window`, `with_decorations(false)`, `with_skip_taskbar(true)`, `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW`, `with_active(false)` | child window, no decorations | `[PopupMenu]`, no decorations | plain, no decorations |
| `borderless` | Undecorated top-level window with a taskbar button (launchers, overlays) | `with_decorations(false)` | same | same | same |
| `child` | Embedded in the parent's client area, moving and clipping with it | `with_parent_window(Win32)` = `WS_CHILD` | **not available**: falls back to `tool` | `with_parent_window(Xlib)` | **not available**: falls back to `tool` |

- A fallback logs one warning naming the style and the platform; `isEmbedded` is then false.
- `child` is the riskiest (a second swapchain over the parent's; airspace and flicker issues on some drivers) and only matters
  for embedding (the editor's Scene view could use it). It is in the API but built last, behind a user decision (D1).
- **`alwaysOnTop`** adds `WindowLevel::AlwaysOnTop` to any style.
- **Transparent windows** are out of scope for now (`with_transparent` plus a non-opaque `alpha_mode` on the surface); the
  option is not in `WindowOptions` until built (D4).

## 5. The Rust `#[iron_api]` shape (`crates/iron_engine_api/src/window.rs`)

Per-thread state with host functions, like `screen.rs`. No winit types: the app translates.

Notes:

- **`focused` twice.** The static `Window.focused` and the instance `win.focused` share a script name. The macro picks by
  receiver (statics are on the class, instance getters on the prototype), but Rust needs two names: the instance getter is
  `focused_now` with `#[js_name = "focused"]`. The plan's first test checks both resolve (`M9-TS-2802`); if the manifest
  rejects a static and an instance member with one name, the instance one becomes `isFocused` and the d.ts says so.
- **Validation.** Unknown style names are ignored with a warning (`create` falls back to `normal`); sizes are clamped to
  `[1, 16384]`; a `parent` that is closed or the window itself is ignored; `child` set after creation is ignored.
- **Closed windows.** Getters read the last state; setters and `focus` do nothing; `on*` returns 0.
- **Events are synchronous** from the host's calls, emitted after the state borrow is released from a snapshot
  (`iron_api::callback::{Listeners, emit}`), so listeners may call the API, open windows or close them.
- **Cross-family changes.** Every setter, `focus`, `close`, `center` and `on*` checks `domain_of(self) ==
  current_domain()` (main-domain code may change any window of the main family; nobody changes another family's windows):
  otherwise a warning and no effect (`on*` returns 0).
- **Static accessors.** `#[property]` on a static with no parameters (and `set_x(v)` next to it for a writable one) is new
  macro support (plan step 3a); `AudioListener.volume`, today `getVolume()` / `setVolume(v)`, can move to it later.
- **Pending windows.** Between `create` and `opened`, `created` is false, `nativeHandle` 0, `platform` "", and the size and
  position read back as asked for (or the cascade position the API computes, so scripts see final numbers at once:
  `position: None` is resolved by the host; the API answers the parent's centre until then).

## 6. Runtimes

| | Compiled (`iron_ts`) | QuickJS |
|---|---|---|
| Declarations | Manifest + `engine_ts.d.ts` supplement: `declare namespace Window { const main: Window; const focused: Window \| undefined; const current: Window; const count: number; function create(options?: WindowOptions): Window; }`, `interface WindowOptions`, `type WindowStyle` | Same globals (installed by `window_api::register_quickjs`) |
| `Window.main` | A static getter in the manifest; `facade.rs::ext_static_prop` already reads no-argument statics as properties | A static accessor property on the class object (`Object::prop(name, Accessor::new_get(..))`, rquickjs 0.14 `object/property.rs`), plan step 3a: `Window.main` reads the same in both backends |
| Messages | `postMessage(data)` / `request(data)` / `broadcast(data)` lower to `JSON.stringify` of the static type (handles are a compile error) plus `postMessageJson` / `postRequestJson` / `broadcastJson`; `onMessage<T>(f)` / `onRequest<T, R>(f)` wrap `f` in a closure that `JSON.parse`s as `T` (and `R` for `reply`); `request` returns a `Promise<R>` from the prelude (`facade.ts`), settled by `onReplyJson` | A JS prelude installed with the class defines `postMessage`, `request`, `onMessage`, `onRequest`, `broadcast` on `Window` / its prototype over the `...Json` natives with `JSON.stringify` (a replacer rejecting handle objects and functions) and `JSON.parse` |
| `Window.create({..})` | `call_ext_args` maps a trailing object literal onto the optional parameters by name, honouring the manifest defaults | New `#[options]` attribute (plan step 3): a single plain object at the first optional position is read by camelCase name |
| `createRoot(win)` | `UiRoot.mount(win, el)`: a third overload `ts_ui_mount_window(window: handle:Window, element)` into its own queue, `iron_ts_ui::take_window_mounts()` | `@iron/react` `createRoot(target)`: a `Window` object (it has `handle`) becomes the target id `iron_core::WINDOW_TARGET \| handle`; the main window is target 0 |
| Callbacks | `Callback<..>` from compiled closures | `Callback<..>` from JS functions (`iron_api::qjs::keep_function`) |
| Hot reload | `Native::reload` | QuickJS reload in `reload_scripts` |

QuickJS games run the `@iron/engine` path and the app does not install `iron_native` there. The plan installs **only**
`window_api::register_quickjs` into the app's QuickJS runtime (`QuickJsRuntime::add_native`), so bun-built games get the same
global `Window`; `js/engine` adds `window.ts` (types and a re-export of `globalThis.Window`).

#[derive(Clone)]
pub enum WindowHost { Os(Arc<winit::window::Window>), Virtual { width: u32, height: u32, scale: f64 } }
```

### 7.2 `PlatformApp` additions (default methods: one-window apps compile and behave as before)

```rust
/// Window commands for the platform to run on the event loop (after input, after each frame).
fn take_window_commands(&mut self) -> Vec<WindowCommand> { Vec::new() }
/// A window from `WindowCommand::Open` exists. Physical size is in the host.
fn window_opened(&mut self, _key: WindowKey, _host: WindowHost) {}
fn window_open_failed(&mut self, _key: WindowKey, _error: String) {}
/// An event of any window. The default sends the main window's to `input` and drops the rest.
fn window_input(&mut self, key: WindowKey, event: InputEvent) { if key == WindowKey::MAIN { self.input(event) } }
/// The user asked to close `key`; true lets it close. Closing the main window ends `run`.
fn close_requested(&mut self, _key: WindowKey) -> bool { true }
/// `key` is closing: drop its surface and every clone of its OS window now, before the platform drops its own.
/// Called deepest-first for a window's children.
fn window_closed(&mut self, _key: WindowKey) {}
/// Called once per loop iteration after all queued events (focus is settled then, see 8.3).
fn events_done(&mut self) {}
/// Windows whose first frame is drawn: the platform shows them (they are made hidden).
fn take_windows_to_show(&mut self) -> Vec<WindowKey> { Vec::new() }
```

New `InputEvent` variants: `Moved { x: i32, y: i32 }` (physical outer position) and `ScaleChanged(f64)`.
`convert_window_event` maps `WindowEvent::Moved` and `ScaleFactorChanged`.

### 7.3 The winit runner

`Runner` keeps `ids: HashMap<WindowId, WindowKey>`, `windows: BTreeMap<WindowKey, Arc<Window>>`, `tree: WindowTree`.

- `resumed` makes the main window as today (key `MAIN`, `window_ready`).
- `window_event(id, ..)` looks up the key; `RedrawRequested` of the main window runs `frame()` as today, of others nothing
  (they draw each main frame); `CloseRequested` asks `close_requested(key)`; if true, closes (below); the main window then
  exits the loop. `Destroyed` of a window we did not close (the OS destroyed an owned window with its owner) runs the same
  close path for that key.
- After input handling (`about_to_wait`, before requesting the redraw) and after each frame, `run_commands(event_loop)` drains
  `take_window_commands()`:
  - `Open`: `plan(spec, Os::current())`, then `attributes(spec, plan, owner_window)`: `WindowAttributes` (title, inner size,
    min size, position, resizable, buttons, decorations, level, `with_visible(false)`, `with_active`) plus, on Windows,
    `with_owner_window(owner hwnd)` / `with_skip_taskbar`, or `unsafe with_parent_window(Some(owner.window_handle().as_raw()))`
    on macOS (owned) and for embedded children; on X11 `with_x11_window_type`. Then `create_window`, `set_black_background`,
    `win32::set_tool_window(&window, true)` when `plan.tool_caption`, then `window_opened(key, WindowHost::Os(arc))`. The
    window stays hidden; after each frame the runner calls `take_windows_to_show()` and runs `set_visible(true)` on those
    (the app lists a window once its first frame was presented and `spec.visible` is set), so a new window never flashes
    its blank background, as the main window does today.
  - Setters call the winit setters. `SetKind` recomputes the plan and applies decorations, level, skip taskbar and the tool
    style (`win32::set_tool_window(&w, on)`); owner changes need recreating the window and are not supported (the request is
    ignored with a warning).
  - `Close(key)`: `tree.close_order(key)`; for each `k`: `app.window_closed(k)`, remove from maps (dropping our `Arc`, which
    destroys the OS window). The main window never closes this way (`Application.quit` covers it).
- **Screenshot runs** (`WindowConfig::virtual_windows = true`): `Open` makes no OS window; it calls
  `window_opened(key, WindowHost::Virtual { width, height, scale: main's scale })` with the physical size, and setters update
  the virtual record and echo `Resized` / `Moved` to `window_input`.

`win32` helpers (`#[cfg(windows)]`, in `windows.rs` or `platform.rs` next to `set_black_background`):

```rust
/// Small caption, no taskbar button, not in Alt-Tab; kept through winit's style rewrites by a subclass that adds
/// WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW (and removes WS_EX_APPWINDOW) in WM_STYLECHANGING for GWL_EXSTYLE.
pub(crate) fn set_tool_window(window: &Window, on: bool);
```

`SetWindowSubclass(hwnd, Some(tool_proc), TOOL_SUBCLASS_ID, 0)`; `tool_proc` handles `WM_STYLECHANGING` with `wparam ==
GWL_EXSTYLE`, and `WM_NCDESTROY` by `RemoveWindowSubclass`; everything goes on to `DefSubclassProc`. `on = false` removes the
subclass and clears the bit the same way.

### 7.4 The fake platform (`crates/iron_platform/src/fake.rs`)

Drives any `PlatformApp` without winit, a display or a GPU, for unit tests:

```rust
pub struct FakePlatform<A: PlatformApp> { app: A, windows: BTreeMap<WindowKey, FakeWindow>, tree: WindowTree, exited: bool }
pub struct FakeWindow { pub spec: WindowSpec, pub plan: NativePlan, pub physical: (u32, u32), pub scale: f64,
                        pub focused: bool, pub minimized: bool, pub maximized: bool }
impl<A: PlatformApp> FakePlatform<A> {
    pub fn new(app: A, main: WindowSpec, scale: f64) -> Self;  // opens MAIN as Virtual (window_opened, not window_ready)
    pub fn os(self, os: Os) -> Self;                            // which platform's `plan` to apply (default Windows)
    pub fn step(&mut self);              // run_commands, frame(), run_commands, events_done()
    pub fn send(&mut self, key: WindowKey, event: InputEvent);  // window_input
    pub fn user_close(&mut self, key: WindowKey) -> bool;       // CloseRequested path; true if closed
    pub fn focus(&mut self, key: WindowKey);                    // Focused(false) to the old, Focused(true) to the new
    pub fn window(&self, key: WindowKey) -> Option<&FakeWindow>;
    pub fn keys(&self) -> Vec<WindowKey>;
    pub fn exited(&self) -> bool;
    pub fn app(&mut self) -> &mut A;
}
```

The same `run_commands` logic is shared: a private `trait Backend { fn open(..) -> Result<WindowHost, String>; fn apply(..);
fn destroy(..); }` with `WinitBackend<'a>(&'a ActiveEventLoop, ...)` and `FakeBackend`, and one generic
`fn run_commands<B: Backend>(app, backend, tree, cmds)`, so the fake tests the real command path, not a copy.

## 8. The app (`crates/iron_app`)

### 8.1 Per-window state (`crates/iron_app/src/windows.rs`)

```rust
pub struct AppWindow {
    pub key: WindowKey,
    pub host: WindowHost,
    pub surface: Option<WindowSurface>,       // Os windows
    pub offscreen: Option<OffscreenTarget>,   // Virtual windows
    pub tree: UiTree,
    pub interaction: Interaction,
    pub sheets: HashMap<u32, u32>,            // app sheet key -> tree id (as panels)
    pub pointer_px: Option<(f32, f32)>,
    pub buttons_down: u32,
    pub cursor: &'static str,
    pub physical: (u32, u32),
    pub scale: f64,
    pub drawn: bool,
}
pub struct AppWindows { pub map: BTreeMap<WindowKey, AppWindow>, focused: BTreeSet<WindowKey> }

/// One per family (section 3a). The main domain's lifecycle is the existing `App::lifecycle`.
pub struct Domain {
    pub id: DomainId,
    pub focused: bool,
    /// Isolated domains only (the main one keeps `App::lifecycle`): paused when unfocused and `runInBackground` is off.
    pub lifecycle: Option<lifecycle::Lifecycle>,
    /// Input and UI events of its windows, queued by `window_input` and dispatched in `pump_domains`.
    pub queue: VecDeque<(WindowKey, InputEvent)>,
}
pub struct Domains { pub map: BTreeMap<DomainId, Domain> }
```

Per-domain `input` state lives in `iron_engine_api::input` (its `State` becomes a map by `DomainId` with the current domain
chosen by `window::current_domain()`; the main domain is the existing state, so existing code reads the same). For QuickJS
games, `@iron/engine`'s `input` stays the main domain's in phase A: isolated windows get keys through their UI events only
(listed as a difference).

The main window is **not** an `AppWindow`: `self.ui`, `self.interaction`, `Gfx.surface` stay as they are, so single-window
games run the same code. `Surface` gains `Window(u32)` for the routing helpers (`handle_on`, `update_cursor`, `update_ime`).

### 8.2 Flow per frame

1. Scripts run (`tick`, UI events). `window::take_requests()` -> `WindowCommand`s (`requests_to_commands`, pure, tested),
   queued for `take_window_commands`; `Title(MAIN, t)` calls `gfx.window.set_title(t)` directly.
2. The platform opens windows: `window_opened` makes the `AppWindow` (tree from `new_panel_tree` with the screen's fonts and
   stylesheets; surface from `Gpu::create_window_surface`, or an `OffscreenTarget` for `Virtual`) and reports
   `window::opened(w, Opened { .. })`.
3. Mounts: QuickJS commits with target `WINDOW_TARGET | handle` go to that window's tree (a commit before the window opened is
   kept in a pending list, as panels do with commits before their component starts); compiled `take_window_mounts()` render
   with a per-window `iron_ui_native::Runtime` (`native_render.rs` keeps `runtimes` for panels; windows get a second map),
   flushed every frame.
4. **Domains.** `pump_domains(now_ms)` once per frame, main domain first: inside `window::enter_domain(d)` it calls
   `window::deliver(d, now_ms)` (messages, requests, replies, timeouts), fires `d`'s due timers unless `d` is paused (compiled:
   `ts_rt_timers_advance_domain(now_ms, d)`; QuickJS: the timers prelude keeps a domain tag per timer), dispatches `d`'s queued
   input, then flushes `d`'s UI roots. The main domain's scene tick (`tick`) runs in the main domain's turn as today.
5. `frame()`: after the main window presents, each open `AppWindow` with a visible, non-zero size draws its tree:
   `tree.set_size(physical / scale)`, `load_images`, `tree.draw_list()`, `renderer.render(gpu, target, CLEAR, cmds)` into its
   surface (`present_with`, vsync always off) or offscreen target. A window's first draw sets `drawn`, and the platform shows it.

### 8.3 Input routing

| Event from | Goes to |
|---|---|
| Main window | As today (screen, world panels, game input of the main domain) |
| Any other window: pointer, wheel | Queued for its domain; dispatched to that window's `Interaction` (its own hover, active, capture: `buttons_down` per window) through `__iron_ui_event` with the window's target (QuickJS) or the window's native runtime |
| Any other window: keys, IME | Queued for its domain; that window's `Interaction` (keyboard focus is per OS window, so the OS already sent them to the right one), then the **domain's** `input` state unless typing in a text field. A tool window's keys therefore reach the main game's `input` (same family); an isolated window's never do |
| Modifiers | Every tree of that window's family |
| Gamepads | To the focused domain's `input`, or the main domain's when none is focused |
| Raw mouse motion | The main domain's, while one of its windows is focused |
| File drops | Main window only (other windows log and ignore them for now) |
| Focus | `focused` set per window; `events_done()` recomputes each domain's focus (any window of the family focused) once per batch, so focus moving from the main window to its tool window (Focused(false) then Focused(true)) never unfocuses the main domain. The main domain's change goes to `Lifecycle::set_focused` (pause, mute, `onApplicationFocus`); each domain's change to `window::domain_focus_changed`. `window::focus_changed` runs per window |
| Resized / Moved / ScaleChanged | `WindowSurface::resize`, `window::resized/moved/scale_changed` (UI pixels: physical / scale) |
| CloseRequested | `close_requested` -> `window::close_requested(w)` inside the script scope; main window: if allowed, the game ends as today |

`Window.current` is set with `window::enter_current(w)` around every dispatch of a window's events and callbacks, inside
`enter_domain(domain_of(w))`.

**When the app pauses.** `PlatformApp::paused()` is true only when every domain is paused. When the main domain is paused but
an isolated domain is not, frames continue (its windows stay live) but the main domain's tick is skipped as today, and the
frame interval is capped at 1/30 s so a paused game with an open inspector does not spin the GPU.
`Cursor.lockState` and custom cursors stay the main window's; CSS `cursor` of a secondary window's UI sets that window's cursor.

### 8.4 Closing

- User close: `close_requested` (listeners may cancel). Then the platform's `Close` path: children first; for each
  `window_closed(k)`: drop the native runtime (its effects' cleanups run), drop the tree, the surface, the `Arc<Window>`,
  then `window::closed(w)` (onClosed). Order matters: a wgpu surface must be dropped before its HWND is destroyed.
- `win.close()`: the same without `onCloseRequested`.
- The main window: cancelable `onCloseRequested`; otherwise the game ends (children are not closed one by one; `App::drop`
  drops everything before the event loop ends).

### 8.5 Screenshot runs

`--screenshot out.png` keeps writing the main window to `out.png` and also writes every open secondary window, drawn offscreen at
its size and the main window's scale, to `out-<slug>.png`: `slug(title)` lowercases, turns every run of characters other than
`a-z0-9` into `-`, trims `-`; an empty slug is `window<handle>`; a slug already used in this run gets `-<handle>`. With
`--frames N` the files are written on the same frame. No OS window and no swapchain is made for them.

### 8.6 The main window's title

`set_main(manifest.title, ..)` at startup; the window opens with it (unchanged code path). `Window.main.title = t` calls
`set_title`. A hot reload keeps the current title (the new code may set it again). `Application.productName` stays the
manifest title: it is the product, the window title is the game's to change.

## 9. Hot reload

- **Before** the old code goes (`Native::reload`, QuickJS `reload_scripts`): `window::reload_begin()` drops every window
  listener (they hold the old code's closures), drops the window UI roots (the new code mounts again), and returns the open
  windows that have **no key**: the host closes them (children first, no `onCloseRequested`; `onClosed` is not run either,
  since its listeners are gone). Windows **with a key** stay open, with their position and size, marked unclaimed.
- The new code runs. `Window.create({ key })` with the key of an unclaimed window returns **that** window (its handle, its OS
  window): the new title, style and flags apply, the size and position are kept (the player may have moved it). A different
  `parent` is ignored with a warning. `createRoot(win)` mounts the new UI.
- After the first frame of the new code: `window::reload_end()` returns keyed windows nobody claimed; the host closes them.
- The main window always stays; its listeners are dropped and re-registered by the new code.
- Families keep their shape: a kept isolated root keeps its domain id. Queued messages, pending requests (their promises
  belong to the old code) and domain timers are dropped at `reload_begin`.
- Fast Refresh (QuickJS dev builds) keeps React roots; window roots behave like panel roots there.

`window::reset()` (tests, shutdown) closes nothing on the OS side: it is per-thread script state only. `Native::shutdown` and
the QuickJS teardown call it with the other resets.

## 10. A 3D view in a window (designed, built later: D3)

`Camera.targetWindow: Window | null` (`camera.rs`: `target_window: u32`, 0 = the main window). `render_sync` and `world_view`
group cameras by target; `WorldViews::views(scene, size, quads)` gets a `target` filter. In `frame()`, a secondary window with
cameras draws `draw_frame(gpu, renderer, world, target, views, textures, cmds)` instead of the UI-only path, so its UI blends
over its own world view. Shadows are drawn once a frame (already the case), so a second view adds a main pass, not a shadow pass.
Render textures (`Camera.targetTexture`) already work and are the fallback: a tool window can show a camera through an `<image>`
of a render texture with no new renderer code.

## 11. The editor

`docs/editor.md` lists "panels cannot float in windows of their own". With this API, undocking a dock panel is
`Window.create({ style: "tool", parent: Window.main, title, x, y, width, height, key: "dock:" + id })` plus mounting the panel's
content with `createRoot(win)`; docking back closes the window. Keys keep floating panels across reloads, and the layout saved in
PlayerPrefs (`editor.layout`) can store their rectangles. Drag-out (a tab dragged outside the window) needs the cursor position
outside the window: `cursor_in_window` exists for Windows. Not in this plan.

## 12. Out of scope

- Fullscreen secondary windows, per-window `Screen`/display modes, multiple monitors' selection (`docs/platform.md` limit).
- Transparent and click-through windows (D4), modal dialogs that disable the owner (D2), embedded `child` windows (D1),
  `Camera.targetWindow` (D3).
- macOS `NSPanel` utility windows, X11 `WM_TRANSIENT_FOR`, Wayland parents (winit 0.30 has none).
- File drops onto secondary windows, drag and drop between windows, per-window UI scale (`setUiScale` is the main window's).
- Windows on mobile (iOS / Android): `Window.create` returns a window that never opens; `open_failed` closes it with a
  warning.
- Domains on their own thread (phase B) or process (phase C), section 3a. QuickJS games' `input` per domain.
- A redraw-on-change mode for idle tool windows (they draw every main frame; with vsync off that is as often as the main window).

## 13. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| GPU instability with more swapchains | Every automated check is fake-backend or screenshot (virtual windows, no swapchain). Secondary windows present with vsync off and are skipped when hidden or minimised. The plan never opens an interactive window; the manual check in the window is left to the user (decision U6). |
| winit rewrites `GWL_EXSTYLE` | The subclass keeps `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` (2.1). |
| Surface used after its HWND died (owned windows die with their owner) | `close_order` drops descendants' surfaces first; `Destroyed` of an unknown close runs the same path. |
| Pausing flicker when focus moves between the game's windows | Focus is aggregated in `events_done()` (8.3). |
| Vsync with N FIFO swapchains divides the frame rate | Secondary windows never use vsync (2.2). |
| `focused` as a static and an instance member | `#[js_name]`, checked by `M9-TS-2802`, fallback `isFocused` (5). |
| QuickJS options objects | New `#[options]` macro attribute with its own tests (plan step 3). |
| One heap for all domains (phase A): code can still share module variables across families | Documented; the API refuses cross-family window changes and handles in messages, which covers what the engine owns. Phase B gives real isolation. |
| Timers per domain need runtime support | A domain tag per timer in `iron_ts_rt` (`event.rs`) and the QuickJS timers prelude (plan step 9b); until then timers fire in the main domain. |
| Per-domain `input` changes a widely used module | The main domain is the existing state; only reads made with another domain current see a different one (tests in 9a). |
| Large `iron_app` changes | Main-window code paths are untouched; new code lives in `windows.rs`; `PlatformApp` methods have defaults. |

## 14. Decisions (answered by the user, 2026-10-21)

- **U1** `isChild` = the window has a parent. **Confirmed.** `isEmbedded` is the `WS_CHILD` case.
- **Window.main** is a reference to the original window that owns the process (the root of everything), read as a property in
  both backends: QuickJS gets static accessors on handle classes (plan step 3a) instead of a `main()` function.
- **U2 / U3 replaced by families and domains** (section 3a): a focused window gets the input; the game is focused when its
  main window or any window of the main family has focus; a window without a parent is an isolated family with its own
  event domain (input, focus, pause, timers, UI roots).
- **Event loop**: one winit loop on the main thread (a hard limit); per-domain dispatch queues now (phase A), a thread per
  domain and a process per domain later (phases B and C).
- **Messages** (section 3b): `postMessage`, `onMessage`, `broadcast`, `request` / `onRequest`; the only way between families.
- **U4** hot reload keeps keyed windows: yes. **U5** secondary windows vsync off: yes. **U6** no OS windows for secondary
  windows in screenshot runs: yes.
- **D1** embedded `child`, **D2** modal dialogs, **D3** `Camera.targetWindow`, **D4** transparent windows: optional later steps,
  not blocking. **D5** (hidden main window in screenshot runs) stays optional.
