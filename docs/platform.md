# Window, display, frame pacing and saved settings

How the window's mode, vsync, the frame cap and `PlayerPrefs` work. Code: `platypus_platform`
([display.rs](../crates/platypus_platform/src/display.rs), [platform.rs](../crates/platypus_platform/src/platform.rs)),
`platypus_render` ([surface.rs](../crates/platypus_render/src/surface.rs)), `platypus_app`
([display.rs](../crates/platypus_app/src/display.rs), [prefs.rs](../crates/platypus_app/src/prefs.rs),
[logging.rs](../crates/platypus_app/src/logging.rs),
[main.rs](../crates/platypus_app/src/main.rs)) and `@platypus/engine`
([screen.ts](../js/engine/src/screen.ts), [prefs.ts](../js/engine/src/prefs.ts),
[app.ts](../js/engine/src/app.ts), [quality.ts](../js/engine/src/quality.ts)).

## Window modes

`FullScreenMode` has Unity's four modes (scripts use the names):

| Mode | What the window does |
|---|---|
| `ExclusiveFullScreen` | The display switches to the chosen size and refresh rate |
| `FullScreenWindow` | A borderless window covering the monitor at its own resolution |
| `MaximizedWindow` | A normal window, maximized |
| `Windowed` | A normal window of the chosen size |

`DisplaySettings` is the mode plus width, height (physical pixels) and refresh rate (Hz, 0 means
"the monitor's rate"). The default is windowed, 1280x720. A width and height of 0 mean "no size asked
for"; `window_width` / `window_height` remember the last windowed size.

**Platform rules.** `supported_modes` lists what the platform offers, most fullscreen first:
all four on desktop, three on Wayland (compositors own the display mode, so no exclusive
fullscreen), and only `FullScreenWindow` on iOS and Android. `effective_mode` maps an unsupported
request to the nearest mode: fullscreen requests try `FullScreenWindow` then `MaximizedWindow`,
window requests try `MaximizedWindow` then `FullScreenWindow`. Scripts can read the list from
`Screen.supportedFullScreenModes` and show only those.

**`display::apply`** puts a window in a mode and returns what took effect:
- Exclusive: `exclusive_target` gives the size and rate asked for, or with no size the monitor's current
  resolution and rate (not the smallest mode). `closest_mode` then picks the video mode nearest to it
  (size first, then refresh rate; with no rate asked for, the fastest). The result carries that mode's
  real size and rate. If the monitor reports no modes it falls back to borderless.
- Windowed: `windowed_target` gives the size asked for, or with none the remembered window size. It is
  clamped between 320x240 and the monitor, then requested with `request_inner_size`. So leaving
  fullscreen goes back to the previous window size (`M5-DSP-04`).
- Borderless and maximized ignore the size.

`resolutions` lists the monitor's video modes, largest and fastest first, without repeats.
`current_resolution` is the monitor's size and rate now.

## How settings flow

1. At startup `main` reads the manifest's `platypus.display` (`{ mode, width, height }`) as the defaults,
   then lets the saved `platypus.display` pref override them field by field (`display::from_json`;
   unknown mode names and sizes below 1 are ignored). The window is created at the resulting size.
   With `resizable: false` in the manifest's `platypus.display`, the window opens at the manifest's
   own size (saved sizes are ignored) and can't be resized (`WindowConfig::resizable`).
2. `__platypus_info.display` is set before the bundle runs (`display::state`). It holds the settings
   plus `supportedModes`, `resolutions` and `currentResolution`; before the window exists the last
   two are empty/null and all four modes are listed. It is rebuilt and re-evaluated once the window
   is ready and after every `screen.set`.
3. `window_ready` applies a non-windowed mode **before the first frame**, so the window never
   flashes at the wrong size (it is created hidden and shown after its first frame).
4. At run time `Screen.setResolution(w, h, mode, refreshRate)` sends `screen.set mode width height
   refreshRate`. The `fullScreenMode` and `fullScreen` setters send a size of 0, so the app picks the
   monitor's resolution or the last window size (see above). The app applies it, writes what was asked for to the `platypus.display` pref and
   re-evaluates `__platypus_info.display` with what took effect.
5. **Screenshot runs** (`--screenshot`) stay windowed and never apply a mode, and their prefs are
   kept in memory, so renders are the same every time.

`Screen.width`/`height` (UI pixels) still come from `__platypus_screen`; `Screen.windowSize` is the
physical size from `__platypus_info.display`.

## Log file

`platypus-game` is a Windows GUI-subsystem program, so it has no console of its own. `logging::init` sends the log
(`tracing`, default filter `info,wgpu_core=warn,wgpu_hal=error`, `RUST_LOG` overrides it) to `Player.log`
in the game's settings folder, next to `prefs.json`, with the same ANSI colours a terminal shows. The
previous run's file is kept as `Player-prev.log`. `PLATYPUS_LOG_FILE` names another file. Started from a
terminal, it also logs there: on Windows `attach_console` attaches to the parent's console when stderr
is not already redirected, and piped output (scripts, tests) works as before. A panic hook writes the
panic to the log (`M5-APP-04`).

### Crash report (Windows)

A crash that is not a Rust panic (an access violation in compiled game code, the runtime or a driver) used to end the
process with only an exit code. `crash::install` (`crates/platypus_app/src/crash.rs`, called first in `main`) adds a vectored
exception handler that logs an access violation (`0xC0000005`) or heap corruption (`0xC0000374`) before the process dies.
Other exceptions are ignored. The report goes to stderr and `Player.log` and has:

- the exception code, the address and what the access was (reading, writing or executing which address);
- the nearest exported compiled game function (`name+offset`) when the address is in JIT code. `native.rs` registers the
  functions after each compile (`note_jit_functions`); a local function that is not exported is not in the table, so it is
  only a hint;
- the general registers;
- 112 bytes of machine code around the instruction (`rip-96` to `rip+16`), for a disassembler. Left out when the fault was
  executing a bad address, since the code is not readable then;
- a Rust backtrace.

A release build names frames well only with line tables: build with `CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_DEBUG=line-tables-only`. Pair it
with `PLATYPUS_TS_GC=stress` ([platypus-ts.md](platypus-ts.md#running-a-compiled-game-in-the-process-jit)) to make a missing GC root
crash at once. On other platforms the exception handler is not installed (`Application.crash` still works).

#### Crash report file and dialog

The game maker's guide (the dialog, reports, `Application.crash`, reading a report) is [crashes.md](crashes.md).

When the fault is the game's own (the address is in the exe or in compiled game code, or it is heap corruption), the
handler also saves a report and starts a dialog. A fault elsewhere (a driver) is only logged, since its code may handle it.
`Application.crash(message?, plain?)` (listed with `Application` in [scene-and-objects.md](scene-and-objects.md)) takes the same
way and then exits with code 3.

1. `crash::set_reports` (called in `main` once logging has started) gives the report folder, the game's name, the log path
   and whether a dialog shows. The folder is the one with `Player.log` (the temp folder when there is no log).
2. `crash-<unix seconds>.txt` is written there: the game, the reason, the time, the log path and the details (the
   registers, code bytes and backtrace above, or the `Application.crash` message and a backtrace). Only the first report of
   a process is saved. Screenshot and bench runs save reports but show no dialog.
3. The process starts `<exe> --crash-report <file> [--plain]` with no stdio and dies. The dialog never runs in the broken
   process (`crash_dialog.rs`).
4. That supervisor process writes a small game folder to the temp folder: `project.json` and `build/game.pbundle`, whose
   source is the constants `GAME`, `REASON`, `DETAILS` and `REPORT_PATH` followed by `crash_dialog.tsx`. It runs the folder
   with `<exe> --crash-dialog <folder>`, with `PLATYPUS_CRASH_DIALOG=1` (so a crash inside it opens no dialog) and
   `PLATYPUS_LOG_FILE` in that folder. `--crash-dialog` runs the folder even from a packaged exe or the editor.
5. The dialog's exit code decides: 0 closes, 10 opens the report's folder (`explorer /select`). Any other ending (it
   crashed, there is no GPU) or `--plain` shows the system's message box instead: `MessageBoxW` on Windows (Yes opens the
   folder), stderr elsewhere. The folder is removed afterwards.

Tests: `M9-API-917` (`--crash-dialog <folder>` parses), `M9-API-918` (the dialog reads a report's game and reason).

## Vsync and the frame cap

- `QualitySettings.vSyncCount` (0 or 1) goes out as the seventh argument of `render.quality`. It
  fills `Quality.vsync` (default off: the engine tracks raw performance, so frames are shown as soon as they are drawn;
  the quality levels and `Quality::default()` have `vSyncCount` 0 and the examples have no vsync control; scripts may still set it).
  A saved quality choice never turns it back on (`apply_default_quality` and `_applyDefaultQuality` take vsync from the level). The app calls `WindowSurface::set_vsync` before each frame,
  which switches the present mode between `AutoVsync` and `AutoNoVsync` and reconfigures the
  surface only when the mode changes. wgpu picks what the platform has (relaxed or plain FIFO;
  mailbox or immediate).
- `Application.targetFrameRate` sends `app.targetFrameRate` (-1 means no cap). Like Unity's, it only
  counts with vsync off (the default), since vsync already paces frames. Screenshot runs ignore it.
- The cap is `PlatformApp::frame_interval`. After handling events, the loop in `about_to_wait`
  checks the time since the last frame started; if the next frame is not due it sets
  `ControlFlow::WaitUntil(due)` and does not request a redraw. Input events still wake the loop.
  Otherwise it sets `ControlFlow::Wait` and requests a redraw.
- The target frame rate is not saved; games keep it in `PlayerPrefs` if players choose it.
- `lifecycle::frame_cap(target_fps, vsync, screenshot)` makes the interval: `None` unless vsync is off,
  the rate is above 0 and it is not a screenshot run (`M5-APP-08`). The rate set by scripts goes into
  `__platypus_info.app.targetFrameRate`, so a full script reload keeps it.

## Focus and pausing

[lifecycle.rs](../crates/platypus_app/src/lifecycle.rs) holds `Lifecycle`, which decides whether the game is
in the background and whether that pauses it.

- **Background** means unfocused (`InputEvent::Focused(false)`), occluded (`InputEvent::Occluded`, sent on
  platforms that tell, such as macOS and Wayland) or sized to 0 x 0 (how Windows reports a minimised
  window). `App::input` feeds those three into `Lifecycle`.
- **Pausing** happens in the background unless `runInBackground` is on (`Application.runInBackground`,
  which sends `app.runInBackground`, or `runInBackground` in `project.json`; default off). Screenshot
  runs never pause. Switching `runInBackground` off while in the background pauses at once. The script
  value goes into `__platypus_info.app.runInBackground`, which a full reload keeps.
- `Lifecycle::update` is called from `App::sync_lifecycle` (after each input event and op) and returns a
  `Change`: `paused`, `resumed` (with how long the pause lasted) and `report`, the new
  `(focused, paused)` for scripts when either changed.
- **While paused**, `App::tick` returns early after polling the hot reload watchers: no fixed ticks,
  updates, timers or animation. `Audio::set_muted(true)` fades the main track to silence over 0.1 s
  without losing the master volume scripts set (a mixer opened during a pause starts muted).
  `PlatformApp::paused()` is true, so the event loop requests no frames and waits; it calls
  `PlatformApp::idle()` every `IDLE_POLL` (250 ms), which polls script hot reload so rebuilds show on resume.
- **On resume**, `started` moves forward by the pause, so script time (timers, caret, UI time) skips it,
  and `FixedClock::restart` makes the first frame count as one tick instead of catching up. `FixedClock`
  turns frame times into fixed ticks (at most `MAX_TICKS_PER_FRAME`, dropping the rest after a hitch).
  The mixer unmutes.
- **Scripts.** `__platypus_focus(focused, paused)` updates `Application.isFocused` and `isPaused`, then calls
  `onApplicationPause(paused)` on active components when pausing changed, then the `onFocusChanged`
  listeners and `onApplicationFocus(focused)` when focus changed. A throwing listener doesn't stop the
  rest. New scripts after a reload start believing they are focused and running
  (`scripts_restarted`), so the next update tells them the real state.

Tests: `M5-APP-05` (window events), `-06` (muting, in `platypus_audio/tests/audio.rs`), `-07` (`Lifecycle` and
`FixedClock`), `-08` (the frame cap) and `-09` (manifest and `__platypus_info`) in the app crate; `-10` (the JS
side) in `js/engine/test/app.test.ts`.

## PlayerPrefs

`PlayerPrefs` has `getInt`/`getFloat`/`getString` (with a fallback; a key of the wrong type gives the
fallback, ints are truncated), `setInt`/`setFloat`/`setString`, `hasKey`, `deleteKey`, `deleteAll`
and `save`. Values are numbers and strings.

- **File.** One JSON object per game, `prefs.json`, in the OS settings folder:
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\<company>\<title>\`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/<identifier, or company.title>/`
  - Linux and others: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/<company>/<title>/` (or `~/.config`)

  Names come from the manifest and are made file-name safe. `PLATYPUS_PREFS_DIR` replaces the folder
  (tests, portable installs). With no settings folder, or on screenshot runs, prefs live in memory
  only.
- **Read.** The app loads the file at startup and puts it in `__platypus_info.prefs`. `prefs.ts` copies
  it into a map when the engine loads, so reads never cross the boundary. A file that is not a JSON
  object is ignored with a warning.
- **Write.** Sets and deletes go to the app as `prefs.set key value`, `prefs.delete key`,
  `prefs.deleteAll` and `prefs.save`. The file is written on `save()` and when the `App` is dropped
  (so on exit). `Prefs::save` skips the write when nothing changed and writes through a temporary
  file and a rename, so a crash cannot leave half a file.
- **Engine keys** start with `platypus.`: `platypus.display` (the window mode and size, a JSON object) and
  `platypus.quality` (the quality level and its current values, a JSON string). `deleteAll` removes
  them too.
- **Quality.** Every quality or shadow change saves `platypus.quality`. `_applyDefaultQuality`
  restores it when the engine loads (level by name, then the saved values over that level), without
  writing the starting state back as if the player had chosen it.

## Multi-window

`platypus_platform` can run more than one window (design: `docs/research/platypus-windows.md`). One-window apps are unchanged: every new
`PlatformApp` method has a default, and `WindowConfig::virtual_windows` is false by default.

**Keys and types** (`platypus_platform::windows`): `WindowKey(u32)` (`WindowKey::MAIN` = 1; the app chooses the others), `WindowKind`,
`WindowSpec` (logical sizes and positions), `plan(&spec, Os) -> NativePlan` (what a style means on an OS, decided without a display),
`place(..)`, `WindowTree` (parents; `close_order` deepest first; `contains`), `WindowCommand`, `WindowHost::{Os(Arc<Window>), Virtual
{ width, height, scale }}` (physical size), `attributes(spec, plan, owner, embed) -> WindowAttributes`.

**`PlatformApp` methods** (all default):

```rust
fn take_window_commands(&mut self) -> Vec<WindowCommand>;       // polled after input, after frame(), after events_done()
fn window_opened(&mut self, key: WindowKey, host: WindowHost);  // the window exists, hidden
fn window_open_failed(&mut self, key: WindowKey, error: String);
fn window_input(&mut self, key: WindowKey, event: InputEvent);  // default: MAIN -> input(), others dropped
fn close_requested(&mut self, key: WindowKey) -> bool;          // default true; MAIN true ends run()
fn window_closed(&mut self, key: WindowKey);                    // drop the surface + OS window clones NOW
fn events_done(&mut self);                                      // once per loop iteration, after all queued events
fn take_windows_to_show(&mut self) -> Vec<WindowKey>;           // first frame drawn: the platform shows them
```

Call order per loop iteration (winit runner and `FakePlatform::step` alike): events (`window_input(key, ..)`, then the commands
they caused) -> `frame()` on the main window's redraw (then commands, then `take_windows_to_show`) -> `about_to_wait`:
`events_done()`, commands, `take_windows_to_show`. The main window is made in `resumed` as before (`window_ready`, no `window_opened`);
it is `WindowKey::MAIN` in the tree from then on. The runner re-polls commands for a few rounds when applying them produced events
(virtual windows echo `Resized` / `Moved`).

**Commands** (`WindowCommand`): `Open(key, spec)` plans the spec for `Os::current()` (a plan warning is logged), makes the window
hidden and answers `window_opened`/`window_open_failed`; the tree parent is `spec.parent`, else the plan's owner / embed target
(a parent that is not open is dropped with a warning). `Close(key)` closes the window and its children, deepest first:
`window_closed(k)` and then the OS window is destroyed (the platform drops its `Arc`), so the app **must** drop its surface and every
`Arc<Window>` clone in `window_closed`. `Close(MAIN)` and a key that is not open do nothing. `SetKind` that would need another
owner than the window has is ignored with a warning (OS owners are fixed at creation). `SetFlags` reads `resizable`, `minimizable`,
`maximizable`, `closable`, `always_on_top`, `visible`.

**Events.** `InputEvent::Moved { x, y }` (physical outer position) and `ScaleChanged(f64)` are new. `CloseRequested` is not an event
for secondary windows: the platform asks `close_requested(key)` and closes. For `MAIN` it also still sends `CloseRequested` to
`window_input` first (so `input` sees it, as before); a refused close keeps the window. `Destroyed` for a window the platform did not
close (an owned window the OS destroyed with its owner) runs the same close path.

**Per OS** (`attributes`): Windows `with_owner_window(hwnd)` + `with_skip_taskbar`, `WS_CHILD` for `child`, and for tool windows and
popups a subclass (`SetWindowSubclass`, `Win32_UI_Shell`) that ORs `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` into `WM_STYLECHANGING` because winit rewrites
the extended style on every flag change; macOS `with_parent_window` (child window); X11 `with_x11_window_type` and reparenting for
`child`; Wayland plain toplevels.

**Screenshot runs** (`WindowConfig::virtual_windows = true`): the main window is still real; `Open` makes no OS window and answers
`WindowHost::Virtual` (physical size at the main window's scale). Setters update the record and queue `Resized` / `Moved` for
`window_input`. Secondary windows must be drawn offscreen by the app.

**Tests without a display:** `FakePlatform::new(app, WindowSpec::main(..), scale)` (`.os(Os::MacOs)` picks the plan rules) drives the
same `run_commands` / close code as the runner over a recording backend: `step()`, `send(key, event)`, `user_close(key)`, `focus(key)`,
`window(key) -> Option<&FakeWindow>` (`spec`, `plan`, `physical`, `position`, `scale`, `focused`, `minimized`, `maximized`, `shown`),
`keys()`, `tree()`, `exited()`, `app()`. The main window is opened with `window_opened(MAIN, Virtual)` (not `window_ready`).

**Surfaces for more windows** (`platypus_render`): `Gpu::create_window_surface(target, width, height) -> Result<WindowSurface,
RenderError>` makes a surface on the same instance, adapter and device (`RenderError::Unsupported` when the adapter cannot present to
that window). One `UiRenderer` and one `WorldRenderer` serve every window; draw with `WindowSurface::present_with`. Secondary
windows keep vsync off (never call `set_vsync(true)` on them: several FIFO swapchains in one thread can cost a vblank each), and
the surface must be dropped before its OS window is destroyed, i.e. in `window_closed`. A surface cannot be made without a real window,
so this function has no unit test.

## Limits

- One monitor: the window's current monitor is used, and there is no way to pick another.
- Exclusive fullscreen is untested across platforms.
- No HDR output modes.
- Phones and tablets: no safe area or orientation handling yet; only `FullScreenWindow`.
