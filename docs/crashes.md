# Crashes: reports, the crash dialog and `Application.crash`

A guide for game makers: what happens when a Platypus game crashes, where the report goes, what the player sees, how a game
can end itself with `Application.crash`, and how to read a report. How it is built is in
[platform.md](platform.md#crash-report-windows).

## What happens

1. The game hits an error it can't survive: an access violation in the game's program or in its compiled TypeScript, heap
   corruption, or a call to `Application.crash`.
2. Platypus writes what it knows to the log (`Player.log`) and saves a crash report, `crash-<time>.txt`, in the same folder.
3. It starts a second copy of the game's program that only shows the crash dialog, and the game's process ends. The dialog
   never runs inside the broken process: its memory may be damaged, and a dialog drawn there could crash too.
4. The player sees Platypus's crash dialog. If that one can't run (no working GPU, a broken install, or it crashes itself), the
   system's plain message box shows instead.

A Rust panic is not a crash in this sense: it ends the game with its message in the log, as before.

## The dialog

**Platypus's dialog** is a small window drawn by Platypus itself (a built-in TSX program, `crates/platypus_app/src/crash_dialog.tsx`):

- the title, "*Game* stopped unexpectedly", and a line saying a report was saved;
- the reason (for example `Access violation reading 0x28 at 0x7ff6… (in the game's program)` or
  `The game called Application.crash: save file is unreadable`);
- the whole report in a scrolling box;
- the report's path, **Open report folder** (shows the file in the file browser) and **Close**.

**The plain dialog** is the system's message box (Windows `MessageBoxW`) with the same summary and the report's path.
**Yes** opens the folder that has the report. On other systems the plain fallback is a message on stderr.

## Where reports go

| Run | Report folder |
|---|---|
| A normal run | Beside `Player.log`: the game's settings folder, e.g. `%APPDATA%\<company>\<title>\` on Windows |
| `--screenshot` / `--bench`, or no log file | The system's temp folder |

Each report is a plain text file named after the time it was written (Unix seconds):

```text
Platypus crash report
Game: Zombie Horders
Reason: Access violation reading 0x28 at 0x7ff698893242 (in the game's program)
Time: 1793151215 (Unix seconds)
Log: C:\Users\you\AppData\Roaming\Platypus examples\Zombie Horders\Player.log

crash: exception 0xc0000005: Access violation reading 0x28 at 0x7ff698893242 (in the game's program) on thread "main"
registers: rip 0x7ff698893242 rsp ... rbp ...
  rax ... rbx ... rcx ... rdx 0x10
  rsi ... rdi 0x10 ...
code [rip-96, rip+16): 48 89 cf ...
   0: ...
   8: winit::platform_impl::windows::event_loop::EventLoopThreadExecutor::in_event_loop_thread
   ...
```

Only the first report of a process is saved: a second fault while reporting adds nothing.

## Ending a game with `Application.crash`

```ts
Application.crash(message?: string, plain?: boolean): void
Application.crash({ message?: string, plain?: boolean }): void
```

It ends the game at once, the same way an unexpected error does: the log, a report, the dialog, and the process exits with
code **3**. `message` becomes the report's reason (`The game called Application.crash: <message>`). `plain` shows the plain
dialog instead of Platypus's own.

A game should normally end with `Application.quit(exitCode)`. `crash` is for errors the game can't recover from, where a
report and a dialog help the player more than a window that silently closes:

```ts
const save = PlayerPrefs.getString("save", "");
if (save !== "" && !isValidSave(save)) {
  Application.crash("the save file is damaged");
}
```

Nothing after the call runs: there is no exception to catch and no `onDestroy`.

### Trying the dialogs

A component that crashes a second in, with `-- plain` choosing the plain dialog (arguments after `--` reach
`Application.args`):

```ts
class Crasher extends Component {
  private frames = 0;

  override onUpdate(): void {
    this.frames += 1;
    if (this.frames === 60) {
      Application.crash("testing the crash dialog", Application.args.includes("plain"));
    }
  }
}

register({ Crasher });
```

```bash
cargo run --release -p platypus_app -- path/to/game
```

```bash
cargo run --release -p platypus_app -- path/to/game -- plain
```

The dialog can also be shown again for any saved report, without a game (`--plain` for the plain one):

```bash
target/release/platypus-game.exe --crash-report "C:\Users\you\AppData\Roaming\<company>\<title>\crash-1793151215.txt"
```

## When no dialog shows

- **Screenshot and bench runs** (`--screenshot`, `--bench`): nobody is watching, so the report is saved (in the temp
  folder) and the run ends without a dialog.
- **A crash inside the crash dialog** (`PLATYPUS_CRASH_DIALOG` is set in its process): it is logged, nothing more opens.
- **A fault outside the game's code** (an access violation in a graphics driver, say): it is logged, but no report or
  dialog follows, because the driver may handle it and carry on. If the process does die from it, the log has the details.

## Reading a report

- **Reason**: what went wrong and where. *in the game's program* means the exe (Platypus's Rust code). *in compiled game
  code, near `g_Arena_onUpdate+0x1c4`* names the nearest exported compiled TypeScript function. It is a hint: functions
  that are not exported are not in the table, so the fault may be in one just after the named one.
- **Reading or writing a small address** (`reading 0x28`) is a null pointer plus a field offset.
- **Registers**: which register held the bad pointer. In the example above `rdi` is `0x10`, the `0x28` read is
  `rdi + 0x18`, so the code was handed a null `Arc`: the value had been zeroed.
- **Code bytes**: the 96 bytes before the faulting instruction and 16 from it, for a disassembler. Left out when the fault
  was jumping to a bad address.
- **Backtrace**: the Rust frames of the faulting thread. Compiled game code has no unwind information, so the walk stops
  at the first game frame. A release build only names frames well with line tables:

```bash
CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_DEBUG=line-tables-only cargo build --release -p platypus_app
```

  That rebuilds every release crate; build again without it afterwards.

### Chasing a crash that only happens sometimes

- Run the same start many times with `--screenshot out.png --frames 5` and count the reports in the temp folder.
- `PLATYPUS_TS_GC=stress` collects garbage at every allocation, so a missing GC root crashes at once instead of now and then.
- Forced hot reloads during a screenshot run: `PLATYPUS_RELOAD_AT_FRAME=N`.
- [AUDIT-UNSAFE-CODE.md](AUDIT-UNSAFE-CODE.md) (local, not in git) lists the code that can corrupt memory, for a review.

## Command line and environment

| Name | What |
|---|---|
| `--crash-report <file>` | Shows the crash dialog for a saved report, then exits (what a crashing game starts). |
| `--plain` | With `--crash-report`: the system's plain dialog only. |
| `--crash-dialog <folder>` | Runs the dialog's own game folder (the supervisor writes it to the temp folder); works in a packaged exe and the editor too. Not for direct use. |
| `PLATYPUS_CRASH_DIALOG` | Set in the dialog's process: a crash there opens no further dialog. |
| `PLATYPUS_LOG_FILE` | The log file; the dialog's process logs into its temp folder. |
| `PLATYPUS_TS_GC` | `stress` or `off`: the garbage collector's mode, for chasing memory bugs. |

## Platforms

| | Windows | macOS, Linux |
|---|---|---|
| Faults (access violation, heap corruption) logged and reported | yes | no (the process ends with the system's message) |
| `Application.crash`: report and dialog | yes | yes |
| Platypus's dialog | yes | yes |
| Plain fallback | message box | stderr |
| Open report folder | Explorer with the file selected | `open -R` (macOS), `xdg-open` on the folder (Linux) |
