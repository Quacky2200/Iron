# Testing

The plan (kinds, IDs, per-milestone checks) is [TESTS.md](../TESTS.md); the commands are in
[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md). This page explains how the tests are physically organised so you can find
or add one. Every test that implements a plan item carries its ID in a comment (for example
`// M3-EVT-05`) and tests are named after the behaviour they check.

## Running

```bash
cargo test --workspace          # Rust unit + integration + headless render + golden
bun run typecheck               # every example via platypus-build check --tsc (runs cargo)
cargo bench -p platypus_ui --bench restyle
```

There is no `bun test`, `bun run build` or `bun run build:fixtures` any more (the JS packages and their tests were
deleted with QuickJS).

The workspace `Cargo.toml` sets `[profile.dev.package."*"] opt-level = 3`: dependencies (Parley, swash, wgpu)
are optimized even in debug builds, Platypus's own crates are not.

CI ([ci.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.yml)) runs fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, build and test on Windows
and Ubuntu (software Vulkan via Mesa, WARP on Windows). Its old JS job (bun test, fixture check) no longer applies.

## Where tests live

| Kind | Location | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Rust unit | `#[cfg(test)]` inside the source file | [css.rs](../crates/platypus_ui/src/css.rs) (parser, `rebase_urls`, `var()`), [color_fn.rs](../crates/platypus_ui/src/color_fn.rs) (colour functions, `color-mix()`), [input.rs](../crates/platypus_platform/src/input.rs), [assets.rs](../crates/platypus_core/src/assets.rs), [attrs.rs](../crates/platypus_ui/src/attrs.rs), [paint.rs](../crates/platypus_ui/src/paint.rs) |
| Rust integration | `crates/*/tests/*.rs` | see below |
| Compiled-game tests | `tools/platypus_ts_tests` (groups `lang`, `stdlib`, `engine`, `engine_api`, `ui`) | `cargo test -p platypus_ts_tests --test <group> <filter>` from `tools/` |
| Render (headless) | [platypus_render/tests](../crates/platypus_render/tests) | `headless.rs`, `ui.rs`, `world.rs` (world pass, M5-RND-05 to 15, M5-CUL-02) |
| Golden images | `tests/golden/<id>.png` | compared inside `ui.rs` |
| Layout fixtures | `tests/layout/*.json` | run by `layout_fixtures.rs` |
| Fixture assets | `tests/fixtures/{assets,fonts,images}` | glTF and FBX models (`assets/`, some made by its `make_*.py` scripts), fonts (WOFF/WOFF2, TTF) and images used by native tests. The JS bundles and sources that used to live here (`*.js`, `src/`, `package.json`) were deleted with QuickJS |
| Benchmarks | `crates/*/benches` (Criterion) | `restyle.rs`, `layout.rs`, `commits.rs` |

### `platypus_ui` integration tests ([crates/platypus_ui/tests](../crates/platypus_ui/tests))

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `tree.rs` | Commit semantics: ops, moves, removal, errors, text nodes |
| `layout_fixtures.rs` | JSON layout cases through the full commit pipeline, generic over `LayoutEngine` |
| `text.rs` | Fonts (including WOFF/WOFF2 from `tests/fixtures/fonts/`, M3-FNT-03), wrapping, inheritance, shaping counts |
| `text_props.rs` | M3d group 4 text properties through the tree: transform, ellipsis, white-space/word-break, font shorthand and features, decorations, stroke, smoothing |
| `selection.rs` | Static text selection (M3-SEL-01/02): drag, click, double and triple click, Ctrl+C, `user-select`, transforms, highlight and `::selection` draw commands, `::placeholder` |
| `dialog.rs` | Dialogs (M3-DLG-01): hidden, open and modal layout, top-layer paint and hit order, `::backdrop`, focus trap and restore, Escape and backdrop `cancel`/`close`, `closedBy`, `[open]`/`[modal]` selectors |
| `motion.rs` | Transitions, `@keyframes` animations, `@starting-style` and `:outro` removal (M3-ANI-02..05); timing/interpolation/parsing units (M3-ANI-01) are in `motion.rs` and `css.rs` source |
| `css.rs` | Selectors, cascade, variables, `::before/::after`, invalidation |
| `hit.rs` | Hit testing rules |
| `pointer.rs` | `Pointer`: hover/active/click/dblclick/wheel |
| `focus.rs` | Tab order, focus events, `:focus-visible` |
| `clip.rs` | `overflow` and `clip-path` (including `polygon()`/`path()`, M3-CLIP-01) in draw list and hit testing |
| `scroll.rs` | Scrolling (M3c step 4b): offsets and hit testing, which axes scroll, wheel chaining, Shift+wheel, key scrolling, Tab into view, script `scrollTo/By/IntoView`, scrollbar geometry, thumb drag and track paging, inherited `scrollbarColor` |
| `editor.rs` | Text fields (M3c step 5): sizing from the font, typing and editing keys with `input` events, textarea Enter and line moves, prevented `keydown`, controlled `value` / `defaultValue`, read-only and disabled, tab order, pointer caret / word / drag selection, cut / copy / paste requests, draw list (selection, blinking caret, dimmed placeholder, caret kept in view), text cursor, IME pre-edit and commit, focus loss dropping pre-edit |
| `navigation.rs` | Gamepad UI navigation (M3-PAD-01): `Input::Navigate` picks the nearest focusable element in a direction (in-line beats closer), nothing without focus, `Input::Activate` clicks with detail 0 |
| `units.rs` | Relative units and math (M3d step 1): `em` from own font size, `rem`, viewport units, `calc`/`min`/`max`/`clamp` (including `%` math in sizes, margins, padding, gaps and shorthands), `boxSizing`, restyle when font size or window size changes, invalid values rejected |
| `layout_props.rs` | Layout properties (M3d steps 2a-2c; `order` re-sorting layout, `zIndex` paint and hit order, Tab order unchanged, `display: contents` flattening and `position: fixed` placement, paint and hit): `gridTemplateAreas` and `gridArea` by name or lines, `gridTemplate` forms, line longhands, `gridAutoRows`, `placeItems`/`placeSelf` setting both axes, bad grid/place/logical values rejected, logical properties mapped left-to-right |
| `layout_props.rs` (more) | Transforms (M3-XF-02): hit testing follows rotation, 3D turns and `backface-visibility`, every property form and keyword is accepted and resets, `preserve-3d` combines turns before flattening; `visibility` (M3-VIS-01): hidden boxes keep space but draw and hit nothing, visible children and spans still do |
| `wide_keywords.rs` | CSS-wide keywords (M3d step 1c): `inherit` on non-inherited properties, `initial` stopping inheritance, `unset`/`revert`, stylesheets without warnings, `inherit` at the root, `::before` inheriting |
| `common/mod.rs` | `Dom` builder helper: builds ops with a CSS string and lays out a 400x400 tree |

Most tests build a tree by emitting ops directly (helpers such as `Dom` or the `Scene` struct in
`platypus_render/tests/ui.rs`). Tests that need a real reconciler use `platypus_ui_native`
(`tests/reconcile.rs`) or a compiled game in `tools/platypus_ts_tests` (group `ui`).

## Fixtures

`tests/fixtures` holds only assets for native tests: `assets/` (glTF models such as `house.glb` and `worm.glb`, FBX models `cube.fbx` and `rig.fbx` from `make_fbx.py`),
`fonts/` and `images/`. The QuickJS fixture bundles, the `platypus_script` conformance suite
(`runtime_conformance_tests!`) and the tests that drove React in QuickJS are gone.

## Golden images

[testing.rs](../crates/platypus_render/src/testing.rs):

- `assert_golden(id, w, h, &pixels, tolerance)` compares RGBA8 pixels with `tests/golden/<id>.png`,
  each channel within `tolerance` (render tests use 3, to allow driver differences). It panics with
  the count of differing pixels and the first mismatch.
- The `Scene` harness in `platypus_render/tests/ui.rs` builds a tree from ops and CSS. Its optional
  `prepare` hook (`Scene::prepare`) runs on the laid-out tree just before drawing, for state the
  ops can't set up (hover, focus, text selection, an animation clock), as in the `M3-ANI-06` and
  `M3-SEL-03` goldens.
- `PLATYPUS_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 cargo test -p platypus_render` rewrites references instead of comparing.
- Every `assert_golden` call also writes its render to `tests/output/<id>.png`, passing or
  not, for inspection. The folder is git-ignored.
- `cd tools && cargo run -p platypus_shots --bin screenshots [-- names...]` (`tests/tools/shots`, replacing the old `bun run screenshots` /
  `scripts/screenshots.ts`) builds the release `platypus-app` and each example (`platypus_build` as a library), then
  renders it with `--screenshot` to `tests/output/examples-<name>.png`; a window opens for a moment per example.
  `--no-host-build` and `--no-build` reuse what is built. `tests/output/history/` keeps older screenshots for comparison.
- `cd tools && cargo run -p platypus_shots --bin progress-shots [-- names...]` (replacing `scripts/progress-shots.ts`) makes the pictures of
  [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) (see there; `M9-SHOT-01`, `-02`).
  Updating goldens is always explicit; review the PNG by eye before committing.
- `shared_gpu()` is **required** in GPU tests: one device per test binary behind a mutex
  (creating devices from parallel threads can deadlock some Vulkan layers).
- Render tests mostly assert pixels analytically ("this pixel is the border colour") and use a
  golden only as a regression net. They render a scene built through the real `UiTree`, so draw-list
  and renderer bugs both show up. `RenderStats` is asserted for batching and layer counts.

## Benchmarks

Criterion benches track, not gate: [restyle.rs](../crates/platypus_ui/benches/restyle.rs) (incremental
restyle on a ~2,200 node tree, M3-BEN-01), [layout.rs](../crates/platypus_ui/benches/layout.rs) (M2-BEN-*),
and the other benches in `crates/*/benches`. (The QuickJS-era `commits.rs` and `reload.rs` benches, including
`M4-HOT-07`, were removed with `platypus_script`.)

## The `tools/` workspace

The experimental TypeScript compiler (`tools/platypus_ts`, `platypus_ts_rt`, `platypus_ts_tests`) is a separate
cargo workspace, so `cargo test --workspace` at the repo root does not run it. Run
`cargo test --workspace` from `tools/` instead; `PLATYPUS_TS_GC=stress cargo test -p platypus_ts_tests` repeats
the tests with a garbage collection at every allocation. Its tests are `M9-TS-*`. See
[platypus-ts.md](platypus-ts.md) for how they are organised and how to add one.
