//! Absolute boxes that escape clips. In CSS an element's `overflow` clip and scrolling
//! reach an absolute descendant only when the element is its containing block or lies
//! between them in the containing-block chain: a dropdown in a static `overflow: hidden`
//! box, held by a positioned box further out, shows in full and doesn't scroll with it.
//! Painting walks the element tree, so drawing such a box closes the clips it escapes and
//! reopens the rest around it; hit testing and scrolling skip the same elements.
