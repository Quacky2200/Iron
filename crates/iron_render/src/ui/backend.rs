//! What the app needs from a UI renderer, whichever draws it.
//!
//! A backend draws `iron_ui` draw lists ([`DrawCmd`]) into a target. The draw list and the
//! frame plan built from it (`plan.rs`) are backend-neutral: a backend owns only the GPU
//! side, the resources a plan names (glyph atlas pages, images, offscreen textures) and how
//! its [`plan::Step`](super::plan::Step)s run. The wgpu renderer is [`UiRenderer`](super::UiRenderer);
//! a GLES renderer (through ANGLE on Windows) is to be the second.
