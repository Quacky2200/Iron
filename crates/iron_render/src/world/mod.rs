//! The 3D world pass (M5): what the cameras see, drawn before the screen UI.
//!
//! The world is lit meshes ([`MeshInstance`], built-in primitives or meshes set with
//! [`WorldRenderer::set_mesh`]) and quads: coloured or textured planes, such as UI
//! panels in the world. Each camera is a [`WorldView`] with its own viewport and lights;
//! views are drawn in order, each first filling its viewport with its background (which
//! also resets depth there), so later cameras draw over earlier ones, like Unity's camera
//! depth. Opaque meshes go first, then see-through meshes and quads back to front, so
//! they blend over what's behind them. Textures are either the frame's (UI panels,
//! passed to each render) or kept by the renderer ([`WorldRenderer::set_texture`]).
